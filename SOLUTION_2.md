# Code Restructuring and Improvements Log

## Commit 1: Initial Project Restructure

### File Structure Changes
1. Module Organization
- Moved client.rs from tests/ to src/ directory
- Updated module declarations in lib.rs
- Fixed import paths to use crate-relative paths

2. Import Path Updates
- Changed from using external crate path to internal crate path
- Updated client_test.rs to import Client from main crate
- Removed redundant mod client declaration from client_test.rs

### Summary
These changes improve the project structure by properly separating implementation from tests.

Note: This is the first of many small, incremental improvements.

## Commit 2: Fix Client Port Variable Type and Rename Test File

### Changes
1. Port Variable Type Change
- Changed port variable type in Client struct from u32 to u16
- Better matches TCP/UDP port number specifications (0-65535)
- More memory efficient for port number storage

2. Test File Reorganization
- Renamed client_tests.rs to original_integration_tests.rs
- Preserves original task tests as reference implementation
- Prepares codebase for new test files with additional cases
- Better distinguishes between provided and new test cases

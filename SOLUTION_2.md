# Code Restructuring and Improvements Log

## Commit 1: Initial Project Restructure

### File Structure Changes
1. Module Organization
- Moved client.rs from tests/ to src/ directory
- Updated module declarations in lib.rs
- Fixed import paths to use crate-relative paths

2. Import Path Updates
- Changed from using external crate path to internal crate path
- Updated client_test.rs to import Client from main crate
- Removed redundant mod client declaration from client_test.rs

### Summary
These changes improve the project structure by properly separating implementation from tests.

Note: This is the first of many small, incremental improvements.

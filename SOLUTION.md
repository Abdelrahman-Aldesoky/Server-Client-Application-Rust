# Server Implementation Changes

## Detailed Changes with Explanations

### 1. Buffer Size and Message Reading
**Before:**
```rust
let mut buffer = [0; 512];
```
**Why it was problematic:**
- Using a fixed array of 512 bytes means we can't handle messages larger than 512 bytes
- Arrays in Rust have fixed sizes that can't be changed
- If a message was larger than 512 bytes, it would be cut off (truncated)
- Memory is allocated on the stack, which is limited in size

**After:**
```rust
let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];
```
**Why it's better:**
- Uses a Vector (Vec) which is like a dynamic array that can grow or shrink
- Starts with 1024 bytes but can be resized if needed
- Memory is allocated on the heap, which has more space
- More flexible for handling different message sizes
- Can handle messages twice as large as before

### 2. Message Type Handling
**Before:**
```rust
if let Ok(message) = EchoMessage::decode(&buffer[..bytes_read]) {
    info!("Received: {}", message.content);
    let payload = message.encode_to_vec();
    self.stream.write_all(&payload)?;
}
```
**Why it was problematic:**
- Only handles one type of message (EchoMessage)
- No way to add new message types without changing entire structure
- If message decoding fails, we don't know why
- No proper error handling or reporting
- Single responsibility - can only echo messages back

**After:**
```rust
match client_msg.message {
    Some(client_message::Message::EchoMessage(echo)) => {
        let response = ServerMessage {
            message: Some(server_message::Message::EchoMessage(echo)),
        };
        self.send_response(response)?;
    }
    Some(client_message::Message::AddRequest(add)) => {
        let result = add.a + add.b;
        let response = ServerMessage {
            message: Some(server_message::Message::AddResponse(
                crate::message::AddResponse { result },
            )),
        };
        self.send_response(response)?;
    }
    None => {
        error!("Received empty message");
    }
}
```
**Why it's better:**
- Handles multiple message types (EchoMessage and AddRequest)
- Uses Rust's pattern matching (match) for clear, safe handling
- Proper error handling for empty or invalid messages
- Easy to add new message types by adding new match arms
- Separates response sending into a dedicated function
- More organized and maintainable code structure

### 3. Thread Management
**Before:**
```rust
match self.listener.accept() {
    Ok((stream, addr)) => {
        let mut client = Client::new(stream);
        while self.is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
            if let Err(e) = client.handle() {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Why it was problematic:**
- Single-threaded: can only handle one client at a time
- Other clients must wait in line
- If one client is slow, everyone waits
- No way to handle multiple clients simultaneously
- Server gets blocked while handling each client

**After:**
```rust
let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
    while is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
        match client.handle() {
            Ok(()) => {}
            Err(e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock => {
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
                continue;
            }
            Err(e) => {
                error!("Client handling error: {}", e);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
});

// Thread tracking
if let Ok(mut handles) = self.handles.lock() {
    handles.push(handle);
}
```
**Why it's better:**
- Creates a new thread for each client (like giving each client their own dedicated server)
- Multiple clients can be handled simultaneously
- If one client is slow, others aren't affected
- Keeps track of all client threads using handles
- Can properly clean up threads when server shuts down
- Uses thread sleep to prevent CPU overuse
- Better error handling with specific error types

### 4. Server Shutdown
**Before:**
```rust
pub fn stop(&self) {
    if self.is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
        self.is_running.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
        info!("Shutdown signal sent.");
    }
}
```
**Why it was problematic:**
- Just sets a flag and hopes everything stops
- Doesn't wait for ongoing operations to complete
- Client threads might keep running
- Resources might not be properly cleaned up
- Memory leaks could occur
- No confirmation that server actually stopped

**After:**
```rust
pub fn stop(&self) {
    info!("Stopping server...");
    self.is_running.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
    
    if let Ok(mut handles) = self.handles.lock() {
        while let Some(handle) = handles.pop() {
            if let Err(e) = handle.join() {
                error!("Error joining thread: {:?}", e);
            }
        }
    }
    
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
}

impl Drop for Server {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if self.is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
            self.stop();
        }
    }
}
```
**Why it's better:**
- Properly waits for all client threads to finish
- Cleans up all resources
- Uses Rust's Drop trait for automatic cleanup
- Logs any errors during shutdown
- Confirms all threads are properly closed
- Prevents resource leaks
- Gives time for cleanup with sleep
- More reliable shutdown process

### Test Serialization Implementation
**Problem:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_client_connection() {
    // Tests running in parallel caused port conflicts
}
```
**Why it was problematic:**
- Tests were running concurrently by default
- Multiple tests tried to use port 8080 simultaneously
- Led to random test failures
- Made debugging difficult
- Unreliable test results

**Solution:**
```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn test_client_connection() {
    // Tests now run one at a time
}
```
**Why it's better:**
- Added serial_test = "3.2.0" to Cargo.toml
- Uses #[serial] attribute to ensure sequential test execution
- Prevents port conflicts
- More reliable test results
- Easier to debug issues
- Consistent test behavior
